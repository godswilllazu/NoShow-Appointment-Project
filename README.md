# NoShow-Appointment-Project
This project was carried out to analyze the cause of missed medical appointments in Brazil.

Introduction of Dataset

    This dataset collects information from 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

    ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.

    ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.

    ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.

    'No-show' gives the attendance, ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they didn't show up.

    * About 74.4% of patients who missed their appointment were less than 51 years of age and most were between the ages of -1 to 40 years.

    * From the analysis, it shows that patients who didn't miss their appointments were mostly not enrolled in The Brazillian Welfare Program, although most patients (about 88.43%) who missed their appointments were not enrolled.

    * Most appointments between the Months of February and May were missed and are associated with age group 20 - 40 years.
